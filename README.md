## Advanced

This section covers advanced usage of volatility2.

### Profiles

Volatility2 is using profiles to parsed memory image file. Volatility2 supports numerous profiles for Windows machines by default. However, profiles for Linux and Mac OS must be added manually...
This image contains 3 custom endpoints to add your profiles :
- /custom_overlays/linux/
- /custom_overlays/mac/
- /custom_overlays/windows/

You have to add a new volume mapping like this `-v <your_custom_linux_overlays_dir>:/custom_overlays/linux/` and it is the same for windows and mac profiles. 

### Plugins

This image contains all plugins from [community](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/community). To use them you have to specify the following parameter in you volatility command : `--plugins=/home/finder/community/` and it will load all plugins inside this directory. For further information, I invite you to read their README, which explains the specific features.
